I have taken your advice for my medical billing company and created this email template to send to leads that I know need billing help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is the template I have now. Please be brutally honest in your critique.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Good morning Dr. \\[Last Name\\],  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\[Personalized comment found from my research of the target.\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Is your practice still seeking some billing help?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One interesting observation we’ve made is that almost every client we partner with is sitting on additional revenue that has never been realized due to poor or incorrect billing practices, which is partially why the majority of our clients see a significant increase in revenue and a decrease in overhead costs. They also enjoy no longer having to deal with personnel and claim follow-up headaches.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\[My company\\] is a medical billing firm that has been in business for XX years, currently serves over XXXX providers, and specializes in the long-term stabilization of your revenue while utilizing advanced analytics to pinpoint trouble spots and identify new sources of potential revenue that complement your practice. We also offer services that range the continuum of the revenue cycle such as on-demand coding, hospital contract negotiation and more.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I would like to learn more about your practice and its needs. Do you have any availability later this week for a quick call?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thank you,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Latrix  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\[Official Company Signature\\]\n\nBasically, my goal with this email is to structure it as the following:\n\n1. Grab attention with personalized intro.\n2. Reference their confirmed need for billing help.\n3. Identify the most common problem we find in our clients when we take them over and also show the value we add and headaches they can eliminate from their practice. Most doctors have absolutely shit billing offices whether they're aware of it or not and the employees largely suck and good ones are impossible to find/keep. Doctors are also always looking for more money. We solve all of these problems.\n4. Show our credentials and that we're actually a very successful company and not some brand new startup with no track record of success (not that there is anything wrong with startups as we have several we're working on as well). We just need to expand to new markets because we've essentially captured most of the clients in our city and all clients have previously been referred to us through current clients and that won't work in markets in which we have no presence.\n5. I genuinely want to know more about their practice because if I can find a problem they have, there is a 99% chance we have seen it before and can solve it, which I view as a foot in the door because nobody is handing over their entire billing operation until they're incredibly comfortable with us.\n6. I struggle with my call to action. Doctors are fairly busy and skeptical of sales as they get hit all day from pharmaceutical and device salesmen/women. Is a request for a quick call the correct move here?\n\nSo... how bad is it? I'm struggling to shorten it enough to show our value and experience while still not writing a novel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!!",

I'm looking at making a move to a different type of sales job but I need some advice because I don't even know where to start looking, I just know how I want my job to be. I'd like a base salary, the ability to work remotely from time to time, the ability to work my own hours, and something fun to sell. I currently sell entertainment and electronics so I'd like something in a similar industry.\n\nI know that at my current job there's the opportunity to move into more of an inside sales job with a desk and working regular office hours, but I'd like to know what else is out there for me to look into as opposed to staying on the same track. Startups? Other industries?\n\nThanks!!\n\n\n",

I&amp;#39;ve worked for 3 wireless carriers and I&amp;#39;m currently working residential cable. I know the ins and outs of everything and I&amp;#39;m pretty good at what I do, but I want more stability, the retail schedule is killing me. I&amp;#39;m looking at making a move to a different type of sales job but I need some advice because I don&amp;#39;t even know where to start looking, I just know how I want my job to be. I&amp;#39;d like a base salary, the ability to work remotely from time to time, the ability to work my own hours, and something fun to sell. I currently sell entertainment and electronics so I&amp;#39;d like something in a similar industry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that at my current job there&amp;#39;s the opportunity to move into more of an inside sales job with a desk and working regular office hours, but I&amp;#39;d like to know what else is out there for me to look into as opposed to staying on the same track. Startups? Other industries?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
